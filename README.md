# The Bot War: Cybernetic Attack
## Objective
Using data structures & algorithms knowledge, how can we use it in order to prevent a botnet attack or protect ourselves from one.
### What we will be trying to solve:
1. Which data structures are more efficient in order to store this type of information?
2. Which data structures is more efficient to perform a information search?
3. How to know if an access is malicious?
4. How to distinguish a "real" access from the ones that are not.
5. How can we make groups of informacion that characterize these accesses?

## Relevant information
### What is a botnet?
"A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&C) software. The word "botnet" is a portmanteau of the words "robot" and "network". The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation." ("Botnet", n.d.)

### What can we do in order to detect a botnet attack?
One way to detect if your computer is an affected device is through the compilation of all the pertinent information that allows us to perform optimized searches for the detection of malicious access through networks of robots
